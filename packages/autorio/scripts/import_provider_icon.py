"""Import a provider avatar from source artwork.

Turns artwork of any size into the square, transparent, 128x128 PNG the mod's
sprite prototype expects.

A white-background source is keyed to transparent first. That is a flood fill
from the border rather than a global "white is transparent" test, so white
inside the drawing - a maid headdress, an eye highlight - survives.

Framing is the part worth getting right, because every avatar sits in the same
button and an inconsistent one reads as a mistake:

  --slice X0:X1   take one figure out of a multi-figure sheet by pixel column.
  --head N        scale so the head is N of the icon's 128 pixels wide. This
                  is the setting that keeps a set consistent, and the one to
                  reach for by default: the head is measured in each source, so
                  it does not matter how large each drawing is on its own
                  canvas. Squaring a figure by its bounding box instead scales
                  a short drawing up more than a tall one, and the heads come
                  out different sizes.
  --frame SIDE    crop a fixed SIDE x SIDE box out of the SOURCE instead. Only
                  equivalent when every figure is drawn at one scale, as on a
                  single sheet.
  --anchor F      where the widest row sits in that box, top to bottom. The
                  head decides the scale; the bottom decides the placement, so
                  this only positions a figure that already reaches the bottom.
  --no-baseline   do not sit the figure on the bottom edge (see below).
  --scale F       draw the figure F times larger. Measuring the head by its
                  silhouette reads a voluminous hairstyle or a hair ornament as
                  head, and scales that figure down to compensate; no cheap
                  automatic measure told those apart from a genuinely large
                  head, so the handful that come out small are nudged by eye and
                  the factor recorded in the folder README.
  --size N        output N x N instead of the mod's 128. Framing is unchanged,
                  so a larger size is the same picture with more pixels - see
                  assets/provider/ for the archived 256 set.
  --out-dir DIR   write somewhere other than the mod's graphics folder.
  --keep-top F    for single portrait art with no sheet to match: drop the
                  bottom of the drawing before squaring by bounding box, so
                  the costume does not eat the frame.
